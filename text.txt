I  am writing to you as a Second year student of the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Mumbai seeking your help regarding the problems faced by us  
 
We have not been provided with 90% study materials or lectures since the last 3 months. 
Most Professors have not kept in touch with the students. And now professors are not willing to reduce our syllabus, instead are keeping 100% syllabus, that too which are not taught. 
Maximum students have their study material in hostel as no one was prepared for that. 

Many students are from containment zones and are not in a mental state to give exams. 
Maximum students are from rural areas with connectivity problems so it is practically impossible for them to give exams. 
We are not in a condition to sit for exams.
And as far the announcement done by Uday Samant sir on 19th June, Examination is canceled for all willing students of vocational courses 
 
The delay of notice is making students more anxious.

Sir, we are hereby requesting you to please respond to the plea of students as it is not at all possible for us to sit for exams.

Looking for a positive response from you. 
Thanking you in advance:
